# Jukka's dotfiles üíé

My dotfiles and scripts for MacOS and Linux. Dotfiles are symlinked to appropriate directories by handy installation scripts.

## Installation

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Please read installation scripts before usage. You may accidentally override things you don't want to! ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Clone this repository to any location in your filesystem.  (E.g. **~/Projects**)
- Change directory to the previously **cloned** `dotfiles` directory
- Launch the `./installers/install_macos.sh` or `./installers/install_linux.sh` script in **bash**!
  - *Supported options are `-f` or `--force` to force installation.*
  - *Don't use **sudo!** (installer will ask for sudo password, if needed.)*
  - *Installer will ask your permission `[y/N]` to start the installation.*

## TL;DR;

```
git clone git@github.com:jukkapajarinen/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && bash ./installers/install_linux.sh;
```
